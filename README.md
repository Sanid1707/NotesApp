# **Notes App Solution**

Welcome to the **Notes App** project! This solution is designed with modern software engineering principles and clean architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. It features a multi-layered structure with a backend built in **ASP.NET Core Web API** and a frontend in **React**.

## **1. Solution Structure**

The project is organized into separate solutions to promote modularity and separation of concerns:

2. Design Patterns Used
The project follows several modern design patterns to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code:

Repository Pattern
Purpose: Abstracts the data access logic, ensuring the business layer does not interact directly with the database.
Implementation: Located in the Repository Solution with interfaces and concrete implementations.

DTO Pattern (Data Transfer Object)
Purpose: Decouples the API layer from database entities and ensures efficient data transfer.
Implementation: Located in the Common Solution.

Dependency Injection (DI)
Purpose: Reduces tight coupling between components and improves testability.
Implementation: Used in the Service Solution to inject repositories into controllers.

3-Layer Architecture
Purpose: Ensures separation of concerns:
Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
Repositories manage data operations.
Entities define the database models.
Implementation: Separation across Service, Repository, and Entities solutions.




3. Why Separate Solutions Instead of Folders?
Using separate solutions instead of folders enhances modularity, reusability, scalability, and testability:

Modularity: Each solution has a clear, single responsibility, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.
Reusability: Solutions like Common and Repository can be reused in other projects without duplication.
Scalability: Adding new features or integrating with other applications becomes straightforward.
Testability: Independent testing of each solution ensures robust and reliable code.
